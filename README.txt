                        Gameplay
 ========================================================
 The main objective is to reach the green area by avoiding obstacles and defeating
 enemies using elemental weapons picked from the ground. The player can hold up to
 two weapons at a time, a primary and a secondary. If the player picks up a third
 weapon, the secondary gets replaced. 

Single Player: A helper player AI will be spawned in to help
Local Multiplayer: Two players will play at a time (with no helper AI)

*hint: the first enemy you encounter will not die from your spells! You must defend yourself
with the Earth element until it self-destructs.
